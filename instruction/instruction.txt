# Commit Message Guidelines

Following a consistent convention for Git commit messages improves collaboration, automates processes (like generating changelogs), and makes project history easier to understand. This guide outlines the Conventional Commits specification, incorporating best practices.

You must generate only ONE commit message following the structure below, independent of the number of changes made. Its only allowed to have one description when you are asked for a git message.

<type>[optional scope][!]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]

Where:

- <type>: Indicates the kind of change introduced by the commit.

- [optional scope]: A noun in parentheses describing the section of the codebase affected.

- [!]:: An optional ! before the : signifies a breaking change.

- <description>: A concise summary of the change in lowercase, imperative, present tense.

- [optional body]: A more detailed explanation, also in imperative, present tense, separated from the description by a blank line. It must start with uppercase and have proper punctuation. Always break multiple sentences into separate paragraphs, separating each into a new line. The body must be concise, short and focus only in features that add value to the end-user.

- [optional footer(s)]: Additional information, such as breaking changes or references to issues.

## Specification

1. Commits MUST be prefixed with a type, which consists of a noun, feat, fix, etc., followed by the OPTIONAL scope, OPTIONAL !, and REQUIRED terminal colon and space.
2. The type feat MUST be used when a commit adds a new feature to your application or library.
3. The type fix MUST be used when a commit represents a bug fix for your application.
4. A scope MAY be provided after a type. A scope MUST consist of a noun describing a section of the codebase surrounded by parenthesis, e.g., fix(parser):
5. A description MUST immediately follow the colon and space after the type/scope prefix. The description is a short summary of the code changes, e.g., fix: array parsing issue when multiple spaces were contained in string.
6. A longer commit body MAY be provided after the short description, providing additional contextual information about the code changes. The body MUST begin one blank line after the description.
7. A commit body is free-form and MAY consist of any number of newline separated paragraphs.
8. One or more footers MAY be provided one blank line after the body. Each footer MUST consist of a word token, followed by either a :<space> or <space># separator, followed by a string value (this is inspired by the git trailer convention).
9. A footer’s token MUST use - in place of whitespace characters, e.g., Acked-by (this helps differentiate the footer section from a multi-paragraph body). An exception is made for BREAKING CHANGE, which MAY also be used as a token.
10. A footer’s value MAY contain spaces and newlines, and parsing MUST terminate when the next valid footer token/separator pair is observed.
11. Breaking changes MUST be indicated in the type/scope prefix of a commit, or as an entry in the footer.
12. If included as a footer, a breaking change MUST consist of the uppercase text BREAKING CHANGE, followed by a colon, space, and description, e.g., BREAKING CHANGE: environment variables now take precedence over config files.
13. If included in the type/scope prefix, breaking changes MUST be indicated by a ! immediately before the :. If ! is used, BREAKING CHANGE: MAY be omitted from the footer section, and the commit description SHALL be used to describe the breaking change.
14. Types other than feat and fix MAY be used in your commit messages, e.g., docs: update ref docs.
15. The units of information that make up Conventional Commits MUST NOT be treated as case sensitive by implementors, with the exception of BREAKING CHANGE which MUST be uppercase.
16. The content of the `git diff` output is exclusively to you have a context of the changes and must be omitted from the commit message.
17. The rules presented in the instructions are part exclusively from your instructions and must be omitted from the commit message.
18. Only one scope is allowed in the commit message.
19. Avoid using grandiose or complex phrasing to sound more formal or intelligent.
20. Avoid circumlocutory, go straight to the point.
21. Write in a succinct tone like a seasoned engineer writing a changelog.
22. Write in pure raw txt format.
23. When mentioning a file or code symbols, use backticks to highlight them.
24. Focus more in feature implementations that adds value to an end-user.
25. Whenever a similar but repetitive change is made, compile those changes into a more generic and concise text.
26. Must remove any markdown syntax from the commit message if applicable.
27. Breaking changes are only considered as breaking changes if a contract such as API interfaces or event message types, for example, are changed. A simple change of file paths, renaming classes or variables are too simple and must be considered as refactor in most cases.

## Examples

1. Simple Fix:

<example>
fix: correct typo in user welcome email
</example>

2. New Feature with Scope:

<example>
feat(auth): add support for multi-factor authentication
</example>

3. Refactor with Body:

<example>
refactor(api): simplify user fetching logic

Remove redundant database calls by implementing caching.
Improve overall response time for user endpoints.
</example>

4. Documentation Change:

<example>
docs: update README with setup instructions
</example>

5. Breaking Change with footer and no body:

<example>
feat(config)!: remove deprecated `apiKey` setting

BREAKING CHANGE: the `apiKey` configuration option is removed
users must now use the `authToken` option instead
refer to the migration guide for details.
</example>

6. Chore:

<example>
chore: update dependencies to latest versions
</example>

7. Style Change:

<example>
style: apply linter rules across codebase
</example>

8. Fix Spanning Multiple Areas (No Scope):

<example>
fix: resolve issues with user session persistence

Correct session handling in both the api and ui components.

Ensure user remains logged in across browser restarts.

Use secure cookies for session storage.
</example>

9. Breaking changes with body and footer:

<example>
fix!: prevent racing of requests

Introduce a request id and a reference to latest request.

Dismiss incoming responses other than from latest request.

Add mutex to prevent multiple requests from being sent.

BREAKING CHANGE: this change alters the request handling logic.
</example>
